# Ceiling Spawn tester

If you wanna have fun shooting at the ceiling for endless amount of time trying to glich ceiling spawns and then undo it, this is the mod for you

This requries game_mod to be installed in the root of your BO1 folder. Download here: https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod/releases/download/v1.3.2/game_mod.zip

create a fodler called `mods` in the root of BO1 (lowercase is essential)

make another folder for whatever you wanna call this abomination

Copy the contest of this repo in there

Now run BO_mods.bat, go to "Mods" on the TV, click 'moon ceiling test' and click OK to launch the mod.

Mod starts you on round 100.

To un-fuck up the ceiling spawn after spending 20 minutes of shooting the ceiling, open the console (~ key right below your escape key) and type
`/fix_ceiling 1`

This will unfuck the ceiling spawn for more misery

Useful commands to type while spanwing in:

`/god` - turn on god mode

`/sf_use_ignoreammo 1` - Ignore ammo counts (infinite ammo)

`/give microwavegun_upgraded_zm` - give yourself Zap guns upgraded

`/fix_ceiling 1` - Unfuck the ceiling (game sets it back to 0 after doing so)
